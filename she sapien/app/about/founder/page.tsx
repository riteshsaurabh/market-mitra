              I started She Sapien because I was tired of seeing women compromise on style, comfort, or sustainability when
              it came to workwear. I believed we deserved betterâ€”clothes that fit our bodies, aligned with our values,
              and empowered us to show up confidently in any room.

            With over 15 years of experience in the corporate world, Anjali intimately understood the challenges
            professional Indian women face when dressing for work. After struggling to find officewear that was both
            comfortable and stylish, she decided to create her own solution.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Drawing on her background in business and passion for sustainable fashion, Anjali launched She Sapien in 2020.
            Her vision was clear: create a brand that empowers women through thoughtfully designed clothing that fits
            Indian body types and supports ethical production practices.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Under Anjali's leadership, She Sapien has grown from a small startup to a respected name in sustainable
            workwear, with a community of thousands of women who share her vision for fashion that serves a purpose.
